# TreeFelling
Repo of the Minecraft Forge Mod Tree Felling [available here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tree-felling-made-lightweight-and-with-mod).

Small and very lightweight mod that make trees fall like sand (or gravel) if you break one while crouching with an axe! Works on modded trees from almost any mod. 

## **Quick Guide:**

1. Just find a tree or grow one from a sapling

2. Destroy a log of a tree and it will begin the "**Felling Process**":

##### **Felling Process:**

-   Logs above the one that triggered the process will fall like sand and may start leaf decay right away.
-   Falling logs will **NOT** drop anything if they are broken _before_ they turn into a solid block _(to discourage cheesy players from abusing the mechanic)._
-   A falling log will turn into a solid (normal) log when it lands on another solid block. _It also means it will drop its item as normal in this state._

**Quick Tip**

-   Even though "torching" trees by placing a torch beneath when it begins to fall will destroy a tree without making it drop the logs, it can still be used to quickly deforest an area!

## Installation Guide
You have several ways of using a Minecraft mod, but here are 2:
1. Install Through CurseForge Desktop App
2. Manual install

If you want a detailed description on how to install a mod for Minecraft, you can simply google it or find a video on YouTube. There are tons of guides on how to do this for any mod. Just remember that this is a **Forge** mod, not **Fabric** (the installation guide on the latter is somewhat different).
